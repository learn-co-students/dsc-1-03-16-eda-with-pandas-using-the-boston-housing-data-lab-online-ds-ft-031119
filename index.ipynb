    "# Project - EDA with Pandas Using the Boston Housing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section you've learned a lot about importing, cleaning up, analysing (using descriptive statistics) and visualizing data. In this more free form project you'll get a chance to practice all of these skills with the Boston Housing data set, which contains housing values in suburbs of Boston. The Boston Housing Data is commonly used by aspiring data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load csv files using Pandas\n",
    "* Find variables with high correlation\n",
    "* Create box plots"

    "# Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Use your data munging and visualization skills to conduct an exploratory analysis of the dataset below. At minimum, this should include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loading the data (which is stored in the file train.csv)\n",
    "* Use built-in python functions to explore measures of centrality and dispersion for at least 3 variables\n",
    "* Create *meaningful* subsets of the data using selection operations using `.loc`, `.iloc` or related operations. Explain why you used the chosen subsets and do this for 3 possible 2-way splits. State how you think the 2 measures of centrality and/or dispersion might be different for each subset of the data. Examples of potential splits:\n",
    "    - Create a 2 new dataframes based on your existing data, where one contains all the properties next to the Charles river, and the other one contains properties that aren't.\n",
    "    - Create 2 new datagrames based on a certain split for crime rate.\n",
    "* Next, use histograms and scatterplots to see whether you observe differences for the subsets of the data. Make sure to use subplots so it is easy to compare the relationships."
